<p> 
    C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Laboratories. 
    C has become one of the most widely used programming languages, especially for operating systems and embedded system development.
     It is highly efficient and fast and has low-level access to memory and hardware resources.
<p>
    C is a compiled language, meaning the code written in C is first converted into machine-readable form by a compiler before it can be executed.
     The syntax of C is relatively simple, concise and easy to read, making it a popular choice among programmers.

<p>
    Declaration of variables: Variables are used to store data in memory. Their data type, name and value are declared before use.
</p>
    Statements: Statements are instructions to the computer to perform a particular task. They end with a semicolon (;).
    <p>
    Operators: Operators are symbols used to perform mathematical or logical operations on data.
</p>
    Functions: Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They have a return type, a name, and a set of parameters.
    <p>
    Control structures: Control structures such as if-else statements, loops, switch statements, etc., are used to control the flow of execution of the program.
</p>
    Comments: Comments are used to add notes and explanations to the code. They are ignored by the compiler.
