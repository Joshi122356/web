    General Syntax
    The general syntax of Python is as follows:

Variables: Variables are used to store values. In Python, you can create a variable by using a name and assigning a value to it. For example:

name = "John"
age = 30

Print Statement: The print statement is used to output the value of variables or strings to the console. For example:

print("Hello World")
<p></p>
If Else Statements: The if else statement is used to execute a block of code based on a condition. For example:

if age > 18:
print("You are an adult")
else:
print("You are a child")
</p>
<p>Loops: In Python, you can use different types of loops such as for and while loops to iterate over a sequence of values. For example:

for i in range(5):
print(i)

Functions: Functions are used to group a set of related statements together that perform a specific task. For example:

def add_numbers(num1, num2):
return num1 + num2
</p>
Data Structures: Python has in-built data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries that are used to store and manipulate data. For example:

names = ["John", "Mary", "Tom"]
ages = {"John": 30, "Mary": 25, "Tom": 40}
